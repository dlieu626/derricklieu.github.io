            <h2 class="carnnectheadline">  How can we improve user experience in managing a playlist in their favorite mobile music player? </h2>
            <p> In a group of 4 total, we were tasked to pick out a popular mobile music player (Spotify, Soundcloud, Tidal, etc) and find one aspect
                of that app to analyze, breakdown, and create an interactive redesign while documenting our design process along the way. As the principle
                visual designer for this project, I was able to discuss with my team members on various design rationale through our insights from users and
                analysis of other mobile sites to create a coherent, improved redesign of two scenarios: adding songs from an existing playlist to a new playlist and
                deleting multiple songs from a playlist.

              <p> </br>
                  To begin, we needed to interview a total of 10 different users (mostly UCSD students) to create a foundation for our targeted user base as well as 10 unique
                  user scenarios to focus our redesign process on.

            <br> <p> Above we have a general interview guideline for all group members to loosely follow for each user interview. Whenever the user would mention a point of interest,
            it was left up to the interviewer to then diverge from the guideline and to begin asking more on the subject while the other group members documented the conversation,
            took photos or recorded videos. </p>

              With our 10 interviews completed, we decided on three main actions such as creating playlist, managing playlists and any other playlist manipulating actions to
              look into for user scenarios and from there we found examples of good and bad interactions on apps such as Spotify, Soundcloud, Tidal and Youtube to document and analyze
              good workflow and user experience. Below are two examples of good versus bad flow with the first set being examples of adding recommended songs to a playlist and <thead>
              second scenario prompting users to creating a playlist.

          From our analysis of other mobile apps, we decided that it was a big issue that users could not 1. add multiple songs from
          another users public playlist into their own and 2. easily navigate and delete multiple songs from one's playlist and with
          that insight we focused our redesign on remedying these issues.

        <b class="carnnectheadline">  Design Write-Up: Why we chose what we did and how we could have improved </b> <br>
      <p> </br>

        The process from start to finish for this redesign project had many little details that we had to iron out with each other
        at the same time as we were discussing the primary function that we wanted to improve in the music playlist manager. We had to
        discuss what tools we would include in the navbar such as the Home, Search, and Library pages and think about what the main goal
        of a user using this app would want and how many steps it would take to get there.

      </p>

        <div class="row">
          <img src="./img/Music Management/Design Write up/Navbar.png/" class="navbarlong style_prevu_kit" />
        </div>

        <br>

        <p> There is one crucial aspect in which we could have improved and that is in both redesign scenarios, we make a leap of  faith in assuming
          that users will understand that the 3-dot icon is for:
          <br>
          <br> <b> 1. </b> editing a playlist (getting to the option of selecting multiple songs) and
          <br> <b> 2. </b> pressing on the 3-dot icon again to choose an action with the selected songs
        </p>

            </div>

            <p> Making this decision adds an extra unnecessary step while also making it confusing for the user who is normally prompted to
                an option like "Done" or a check symbol to let the user know that this is the option to press after he or she is done selecting
                songs rather than having to recall that the 3-dot icon has those options available. </p>

              <h2 class="carnnectheadline">A prerequisite case study for  <br> Design 4 San Diego (D4SD) 2017 Civi Design Challenge </h2>

              <p> In an effort to solve complex human problems using human-centered design, UCSD announced a city-wide civic challenge for San Diegans to tackle.
                My team's topic was on traffic. How can we solve traffic, a phenemenon that exists because people, cars, and cities exist? Our solution was not a solution
                that resolved traffic, however, we shifted gears from that to "how can we improve and enhance commuter experience while in traffic?" In the end
                we came up with "Carnnect," an car application that would use Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to create a network and community of users stuck in <thead>
                  same traffic to interact with one another, keeping each other positive, entertained, and less stressed.
                </thead></p>


                <b class="carnnectheadline"> Design Challenge + My Role </b>

              <p> </br> How might we enhance commuter's driving experience while in traffic? For my role on the team of 2 others,
              I was the main user researcher as well as the visual designer who made conscious decisions throughout the challenge to figure
              out important elements that would best portray and communicate our problem space, user research, prototypes, and final solution.  </p>



                <b class="carnnectheadline">  The Problem Space + Observations </b> <br>
              <p> </br> Before tackling the issue head-on, we had to know the local traffic scene, infrastructure as well as the behaviors of cars/drivers.
              We wanted to get a holistic view of traffic so we made three different drives on the 5 freeway both ways: one in the morning, one in the late
            afternoon, and one at night. We tried to empathize with those stuck in traffic through different times in the day. Traffic isn't solvable with
            our current technology, infrastructure, and knowledge thus we looked toward mitigating the frustration that users faced while stuck in traffic. <br>

          <b class="carnnectheadline">  Understand: Taking Two Perspectives </b>
          <p>  <br> There were two main proponents in understanding traffic behavior and experience: professionals whose jobs are
            to relieve traffic congestion and normal everyday citizens who experience traffic on a 9-to-5 day basis. In the initial
            week of the 5 week long project, we had contacted various professional traffic engineers/city-planners as well as looked
            for potential user interviews around the local La Jolla region. The everyday commuters, we interviewed 8 different people of
            various age, occupations, culture, gender, and race for a more accurate, holistic understanding of their traffic experience.
            We also were fortunate enough to have been invited to a local traffic engineer industry located in Downtown San Diego.

        <div class="row">

            <h6 class="workheadline"> <strong> 1. Commuters </strong> </h6>
        <br>
            <p> For commuters, we interviewed a variety of ages, gender, occupations, and cultures about their experiences in traffic such as where they
              encountered traffic, "giving us the grand tour" of their daily lives through traffic, as well as some of their driving behaviors.

            <p> After interviewing commuters, we did a root cause analysis on why commuters get frustrated in traffic and dug deeper to understand the reasoning
                behind the frustration. What was it that made traffic so infuriating for drivers? We also created a context chart for various driver behaviors such as
                talking to the person next to them, stretching at a stop, talking on the phone and so forth. This helped us better understand driver behavior as well as
                design a solution to accommodate them.

              We interviewed four different traffic engineers all part of the Chen Ryan mobility company located
            in Downtown San Diego and asked each of them specific questions regarding local San Diego traffic such as existing
            issues including infrastructural limitations, governance and policies revolving around driving, driver behavior, current solutions

          <p> <br> With the knowledge we gained from interviewing professional traffic engineers as well as scrutinizing various academic journals and articles on traffic congestion,
            we realized that traffic was unsolveable with our current limits in technology, infrastructure, and manpower. While we might not be able to solve traffic, we can definitely
            make the experience of those stuck in traffic much more comfortable. Therefore, we wanted to transition from trying to solve traffic to mitigating the frustration and anger
            that drivers in traffic felt and potentially channel it into something positive and productive. In class, we held a brainstorm ideation session in which
            other teams assisted in throwing out ideas in how we would be able to implement our idea of enhancing the commuter experience. Below is some samples of the questions we asked
            in order to understand driver behavior in and out of traffic.

                  In making a paper prototype of our application "carnnect", we were able to better understand the interface and interactions
                  that a user would make as well as behaviors and decisions that our users would encounter while driving in traffic. In using Carnnect,
                  the user would have to be first stuck in traffic (stuck in less than 20mph speeds). If that condition is met, carnnect will detect nearby
                  users also using carnnect. Once connected, users will be able to decide on the "game" they will play together which includes and is not limited
                  to "caraoke," "discussions," "music," "podcast," or "games," keeping all users satisfied and giving them the potential to create memories on the road

        <p>
          <br>
          For our design specifications, we created a branding guide similar to that of the colors of the UC, which uses the navy blue and gold which are colors
          that respectively represent sleek, cool modernity as well as royalty and luxury in a combined effect for a calming, feel-good design when we completed
          our poster.

          <p> </br>
             In the high-fidelity mock-up of the "Carnnect" app, we wireframed the actual interface of how the Carnnect app would look, feel, and interact
             with the user. With this, we were better able to visualize and understand user's interactions with the app, with others in traffic, as well aside
             consequences and safety concerns with using an app like this.

          <p> This last section illustrates the final product of our entire design process; a giant 36' by 56' poster outlining our design process of
            posing the design problem, interviewing various stakeholders, storyboarding and prototyping, as well as implementing the final solution and
            communicating the idea through this visual medium. While discussing with my group members and collecting and analyzing
            all the data we gathered up to this point in the project, I was able to design the poster along with various iterations of it
            to best convey our problem space as well as our proposed solution of "Carnnect."

            At the end of the 5 week project, we had to give a one-minute pitch to an audience of professional
            and industry designers as well as our peers and after that we held a design fair where we'd pitch our idea and solutions to the various attendees. Our poster
            and solution were well-received, however, some had issues with the feasibility of the vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity which we had not done enough research on.
            This was an aspect in our project that we could have spent more time.

                <h3>Trisha Brown Social Media Marketing Campaign</h3>

                <p>Trisha Brown Dance Company is a contemporary dance company created by the famed Trisha Brown who is known for
                  site-specific dance performances in nontraditional venues. For TBDC's performance at UCSD, the dancers performed on a bridge between
                  two lecture halls and on the mini Stonehenge (pictured below with yours truly striking a pose).
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  As part of my social media campaign idea, I wanted to engage the ArtPower audience in a way that conveyed the performance that they
                  were about to see and if they were on the fence about going, to convince them to go. So I came up with the idea of creating a cardboard
                  cut-out of a dancer and to put him on a stand while going around various well-known UCSD locations to go along with the theme of Trisha Brown's
                  "site-specific" work and philosophy.

              <h3>Roland Auzet Design Process (WIP)</h3>

              <p> Roland Auzet is a French percussionist, composer, theater director and upcoming performer at UCSD with his performance emphasizing the everyday role of the
                  car in a person's life. Through his exploration of the sounds and complex rhythms that a car makes using his bare hands, Roland intends to reveal the intimacy
                  between person and car through a complicated but profound interaction with one on stage.
                <br>
                <br>
                I was in charge of designing the poster and for the poster I thought about aspects of the performance and about Roland Auzet and how I could incorporate a visually pleasing
                but also relevant poster that would accurately convey his performance and garner the attention of students to want to attend the performance.
