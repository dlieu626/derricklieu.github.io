                  <p> In an effort to solve complex human problems using human-centered design, UCSD announced a city-wide civic challenge for San Diegans to tackle.
                    My team's topic was on traffic. How can we solve traffic, a phenemenon that exists because people, cars, and cities exist? Our solution was not a solution
                    that resolved traffic, however, we shifted gears from that to "how can we improve and enhance commuter experience while in traffic?" In the end
                    we came up with "Carnnect," an car application that would use Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to create a network and community of users stuck in <thead>
                      same traffic to interact with one another, keeping each other positive, entertained, and less stressed.

                  <p> </br> </br> How might we enhance commuter's driving experience while in traffic? For my role on the team of 2 others,
                  I was the main user researcher as well as the visual designer who made conscious decisions throughout the challenge to figure
                  out important elements that would best portray and communicate our problem space, user research, prototypes, and final solution.  </p>

                    <b class="carnnectheadline">  The Problem Space + Observations </b> <br>
                  <p> </br> Before tackling the issue head-on, we had to know the local traffic scene, infrastructure as well as the behaviors of cars/drivers.
                  We wanted to get a holistic view of traffic so we made three different drives on the 5 freeway both ways: one in the morning, one in the late
                afternoon, and one at night. We tried to empathize with those stuck in traffic through different times in the day. Traffic isn't solvable with
                our current technology, infrastructure, and knowledge thus we looked toward mitigating the frustration that users faced while stuck in traffic. <br>

              <p>  <br> There were two main proponents in understanding traffic behavior and experience: professionals whose jobs are
                to relieve traffic congestion and normal everyday citizens who experience traffic on a 9-to-5 day basis. In the initial
                week of the 5 week long project, we had contacted various professional traffic engineers/city-planners as well as looked
                for potential user interviews around the local La Jolla region. The everyday commuters, we interviewed 8 different people of
                various age, occupations, culture, gender, and race for a more accurate, holistic understanding of their traffic experience.
                We also were fortunate enough to have been invited to a local traffic engineer industry located in Downtown San Diego.

                in Downtown San Diego and asked each of them specific questions regarding local San Diego traffic such as existing

              <p> <br> With the knowledge we gained from interviewing professional traffic engineers as well as scrutinizing various academic journals and articles on traffic congestion,
                we realized that traffic was unsolveable with our current limits in technology, infrastructure, and manpower. While we might not be able to solve traffic, we can definitely
                make the experience of those stuck in traffic much more comfortable. Therefore, we wanted to transition from trying to solve traffic to mitigating the frustration and anger
                that drivers in traffic felt and potentially channel it into something positive and productive. In class, we held a brainstorm ideation session in which
                other teams assisted in throwing out ideas in how we would be able to implement our idea of enhancing the commuter experience. Below is some samples of the questions we asked
                in order to understand driver behavior in and out of traffic.

                      <br>
                      In making a paper prototype of our application "carnnect", we were able to better understand the interface and interactions
                      that a user would make as well as behaviors and decisions that our users would encounter while driving in traffic. In using Carnnect,
                      the user would have to be first stuck in traffic (stuck in less than 20mph speeds). If that condition is met, carnnect will detect nearby
                      users also using carnnect. Once connected, users will be able to decide on the "game" they will play together which includes and is not limited
                      to "caraoke," "discussions," "music," "podcast," or "games," keeping all users satisfied and giving them the potential to create memories on the road
                      to keep.

                posing the design problem, interviewing various stakeholders, storyboarding and prototyping, as well as implementing the final solution and
                communicating the idea through this visual medium. At the end of the 5 week project, we had to give a one-minute pitch to an audience of professional
                and industry designers as well as our peers and after that we held a design fair where we'd pitch our idea and solutions to the various attendees. Our poster
                and solution were well-received, however, some had issues with the feasibility of the vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity which we had not done enough research on.
                This was an aspect in our project that we could have spent more time.

                  <h2>About this layout</h2>

                  <p>This responsive layout is based on an initial grid of
                  four boxes. Once a box is clicked, it gets resized to
                  fullscreen and the other boxes scale down and fade out. In
                  the work section we experiment with another transition
                  which is to show a panel by making it appear from the
                  bottom while scaling the current one down. To see it in
                  action, open the work section and click on one of the
                  portfolio items and navigate through them.</p>

          </div>
            <p> My name is Derrick Lieu. I'm a first-generation Vietnamese-Chinese American and a 4th year Human-Computer Interaction major at UC San Diego.
              I really enjoy learning about design principles and tools (through youtube tutorials mostly) and aspire to become a visual designer who specializes in all aspects branding/rebranding. Truth be told, outside of design and school, I am a complete cinephile (having watched
              over 400 films, over half of that in the last two years). My favorite movies are <i class="movies">In the Mood for Love </i>, <i class="movies"> Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind </i> , and
               <i class="movies">  Synedoche, New York </i> although I have a love for many more. Along with film, I love fashion, specifically streetwear because it acts as <thead>
                 perfect outlet of expression and creativity for me. If you share a passion with design, film, or streetwear, let's chat! :)
